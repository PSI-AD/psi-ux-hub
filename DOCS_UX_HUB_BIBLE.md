# 📜 PSI UX HUB: THE MASTER BIBLE
**Property Shop Investment (PSI) Engineering & UX Manual**
*Version 3.6.0 | "High-ROI Standard" Release*

---

## 🏛️ 1. PHILOSOPHY OF THE SOUL

The PSI UX Hub is the digital manifestation of our Agency's highest standard. Every interaction follows these 10 Soul Pillars:

1.  **Brand DNA Extraction**: Neural vision parses logos/URLs to define a Sovereign Brand Kit.
2.  **Modular Sovereignty**: Design is a collection of Atomic Blocks (Hero, Grid, CTA).
3.  **Predictive Interaction**: AI-trained heuristics generate Attention Heatmaps before production.
4.  **Diagnostic Integrity**: 100-Point Heuristic Engine validates all audits.
5.  **Multi-Modal Synthesis**: Merging Voice, Image, and Text into surgical redesigns.
6.  **The Obsidian Standard**: Default theme: Obsidian (#020617) + Agency Gold (#D4AF37).
7.  **Dev-Handoff Protocol**: Exporting accessible React + Tailwind production modules.
8.  **Global Component Library**: Saving design tokens to a unified Project Vault.
9.  **Historical Transparency**: Complete chronological narrative of optimization.
10. **The Transformation Narrative**: Cinematic presentations justifying design ROI.

## 🏗️ 11. INDUSTRY STANDARDS PROTOCOL
[CITE: 2026-01-20]
The "Niche Intelligence" system holds every audit accountable to sector-specific benchmarks.

1.  **Standard Selection**: Upon project creation, the `industry` category triggers the loading of a standard JSON (e.g., `real_estate.json`).
2.  **The Platinum Delta**: The audit engine cross-references the scanned DOM against the industry's "Must-Have" list.
3.  **Gap Analysis**: Missing components (e.g., "ROI Calculator") are automatically elevated to the final strategic report.

## 📊 12. HIGH-ROI DESIGN STANDARD (REAL ESTATE)
[CITE: 2026-01-22]
Every Property Detail Page optimization MUST include a financial intelligence layer to convert high-net-worth investors.

### 1. Mandatory Formulas
The Investment Analyzer component must implement the following logic:
- **Cap Rate**: `(Annual Rent / Total Property Price) * 100`
- **Cash-on-Cash (CoC)**: `(Annual Rent / Down Payment Amount) * 100`
- **Annual Rent**: `Monthly Projection * 12`

### 2. Behavioral Matching (AI Matchmaker)
- **Visual Weight**: Recommendation cards must carry a minimum "Match Strength" percentage (String-sanitized).
- **Match Pillars**: Ratings should factor in Architectural Style, ROI Potential, and Amenity Clusters.

### 3. Sticky Engagement
- The ROI Widget is classified as a "High-Intent Tool" and must remain in the **sticky sidebar** above the fold.
- The AI Matchmaker is classified as "Discovery Layer" and must use a **horizontal scroll** (Netflix-pattern) to maximize time-on-page.
